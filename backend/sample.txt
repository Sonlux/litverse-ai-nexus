# BookBot: A RAG-Based PDF Question Answering System

## Introduction

BookBot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide accurate answers to questions based on PDF documents. The system combines the power of large language models with a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant context from the user's documents.

## How RAG Works

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods for question answering. Here's how it works:

1. **Document Processing**: PDF documents are processed, parsed into text, and divided into smaller chunks.

2. **Embedding Generation**: Each text chunk is converted into a vector embedding using a model like Sentence Transformers.

3. **Vector Storage**: These embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) for efficient similarity search.

4. **Query Processing**: When a user asks a question, the question is also converted into an embedding.

5. **Retrieval**: The system finds chunks that are semantically similar to the question by comparing embeddings.

6. **Context Assembly**: The most relevant chunks are assembled into a context document.

7. **Answer Generation**: The context and question are sent to a large language model (e.g., Nemotron 3.3 70B), which generates an answer based on the provided context.

## Advantages of RAG

RAG systems offer several advantages over traditional question-answering approaches:

- **Accuracy**: By providing relevant context, RAG systems can generate more accurate answers.
- **Verifiability**: Answers can be traced back to their source documents.
- **Reduced Hallucination**: The model is constrained by the provided context, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect information.
- **Up-to-date Information**: The system can answer questions based on the latest documents without requiring model retraining.

## BookBot Architecture

BookBot consists of the following components:

### Backend (FastAPI)

- **PDF Processor**: Extracts text from PDFs using PyMuPDF.
- **Embedding Manager**: Generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers.
- **Vector Store**: Stores and retrieves embeddings using ChromaDB.
- **RAG System**: Coordinates retrieval and generation using the Nemotron 3.3 70B model.
- **API Endpoints**: Handles document uploads, library management, and question answering.

### Frontend (Streamlit)

- **Library Management**: Interface for creating and managing document libraries.
- **Document Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for uploading PDFs.
- **Chat Interface**: Conversational interface for asking questions about documents.
- **Source Display**: Shows the sources used to generate each answer.

## Use Cases

BookBot can be used in various scenarios:

1. **Research**: Quickly find information across multiple research papers.
2. **Education**: Answer questions from textbooks and course materials.
3. **Legal**: Extract information from contracts and legal documents.
4. **Technical Documentation**: Navigate complex technical manuals and documentation.

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for BookBot include:

- **Multi-modal Support**: Process images and diagrams within PDFs.
- **Document Summarization**: Generate summaries of uploaded documents.
- **Cross-document Analysis**: Answer questions that require information from multiple documents.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to documents and conversations.

## Conclusion

BookBot demonstrates the power of combining retrieval mechanisms with large language models to create a system that can answer questions based on specific documents. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses while providing transparency through source citations.
